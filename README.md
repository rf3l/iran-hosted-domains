# Iran Hosted Domains

A lot of services and domains are outside of Iran and they are restricted or blocked by iranian censorship infrastructure or tech companies around the world, 
for accessing this service you need to use vpn or proxies with tunneling option, apart of this issues when we use 
proxies the domestic services are unavailable because our ip is not in iran for bypassing this issues we gathered a list of 
Iranian domains and services to help you bypass the situation.

## VPN Problems

The following issues arise when using VPN for some Iran hosted websites:

- They may force you to have Iran IP to be able to access.
- They may offer 50% off bandwidth while having Iran IP.
- They may limit speed for non-Iran IPs or VPNs are slow.

## Usage

This can differ depending on which tool you use. You can download the domains list from
the [release page](https://github.com/SamadiPour/iran-hosted-domains/releases).  
In v2ray clients you can set Domain Resolution Strategy to `IPIfNonMatch` for better routing.

## Source

- Iran Domains (Currently, there are only two main sources):
  - [ITO GOV](https://g2b.ito.gov.ir/index.php/site/list_ip)
  - [ADSL TCI](https://adsl.tci.ir/panel/sites)
  - [Custom List](https://github.com/SamadiPour/iran-hosted-domains/blob/main/src/data/custom_domains.py)
- ADs:
  - [adblock-iran](https://github.com/farrokhi/adblock-iran)

If you know of any other source, or you found a website that isn't here, please open
an [issue](https://github.com/SamadiPour/iran-hosted-domains/issues) or add that specific site to `custom_domains.py`
file or contact me.

## How does it work?

I wrote a python script to get files from the above sources. This script runs in GitHub Action and generates domains
files.

Currently, I run GitHub Action manually, however, if I find out when these sources will update themselves, I will make
it run automatically.
